### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm âœ¨Aaron Kempâœ¨.

Over the past 10+ years, I've been diving deep into the world of software development, and man, it's been a wild ride! ï¿½ From crafting lines of C# to architecting solutions with ASP.NET, and juggling data with SQL, I've done it all. Got a thing for Typescript and Angular? Me too! ðŸ”­

My adventures with SQL Server and Azure have given me some serious cloud chops. And let's not forget the magic of DevOps - it's like the secret sauce that brings it all together. ðŸŒ±

But here's the thing - it's not just about the code. It's about creating something meaningful, something that works, and works well. Quality isn't just a buzzword for me; it's a commitment. Every project, every line of code, I'm all in. ðŸ‘¯

So, if you're looking for someone with a passion for tech and a knack for building top-notch software, you're in the right place. Let's make something awesome together! ðŸ˜„

Cheers,
Aaron ðŸ“«
